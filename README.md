# Listifer Keyword Blacklist

We populated the first version of this list with some of the words marked `possibly_offensive=true` and/or `flags=offensive` in the [en_wordlist.combined.gz Android (KitKat) dictionary](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME/+/master/dictionaries/).

## "Why blacklist any keywords?"

The relevant portion of Listifer's [terms of use](https://listifer.com/terms) can be summed up as follows:

1. No hate, intimidation, or harrassment.
2. No objectification.
3. No victimization.
4. Nothing illegal.

Blacklisting certain keywords helps us encorce this policy.
