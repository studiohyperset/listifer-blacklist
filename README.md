# Listifer Keyword Blacklist

We populated the first version of this list with some of the words marked `possibly_offensive=true` and/or `flags=offensive` in the `en_wordlist.combined.gz` portion of the [Android (KitKat) dictionary](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME/+/master/dictionaries/).

## "Why blacklist any keywords at all?"

The relevant portion of Listifer's [terms of use](https://listifer.com/terms) can be summed up as follows.

We do not allow Listifer to be used in any way that:

1. Spreads hate.

2  Results in intimidation or harrassment.

3. Causes objectification or victimization.

4. Facilitates illegal activity.

Blacklisting certain keywords helps us enforce this policy.
